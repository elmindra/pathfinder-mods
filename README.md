Mods for Pathfinder: Kingmaker
===

Eldritch Arcana (work in progress)
---

This mod adds the Oracle class, new spells, magic-themed feats, character traits, and other fun things from PnP Pathfinder.

*Note: this was last tested against the PF:K 1.3.0. While I tried to test everything, some features may not work properly yet.
If you have a build in mind, I recommend using [Bag of Tricks](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/26)
to level up your character to high level, quick save & load, then test out the abilities you want to use.
You can file bugs on [github](https://github.com/jennyem/pathfinder-mods/issues) or report them using the
Nexus mods page.*

*Note 2: life happened and I've been unable to spend as much hobby time in Q1 2019 as I'd hoped.
Should have a lot more free time starting in May; I hope to resume work on the spells/feats/classes
that I've been developing behind the scenes, as well as other bug fixes. Cheers!*

1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)

Metamagic Feats:

- [Elemental Spell](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/elemental-spell-metamagic/) (Fire/Cold/Electricity/Acid)

Items:

- [Metamagic Rods](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/rods/metamagic-rods/) for new metamagics,
  placed in appropriate vendors/loot tables (e.g. if a vendor or drop has a metamgic rod, it adds
  all the new ones of similar power level, to keep the pacing similar to the base game.)
- [Scrolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls/) for new spells, placed near similar
  level scrolls in vendor tables.

Bug fixes:

- Wings (and fly, air walk) now to grant immunity to ground spells, such as:
  Grease, Obsidian Flow, and Tar Pool. They also grant immunity to Trip (as in PnP).
- [Elemental Body](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body/) polymorph forms
  now allow spellcasting, as in PnP (when in humanoid form).
- [Fiery Body](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fiery-body/) now grants the bonuses
  that come with flight (via red wings).
- Fixed [Spell Specialization](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-specialization/)
  so you can choose spells that you know, but that weren't from your class spell list
  (for example, spells granted by Sorcerer Bloodlines and Oracle Mysteries).
- Fixed [Eldritch Knight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/eldritch-knight/)
  prerequisite to require a class that grants proficiency in all martial weapons, as in PnP.
  Does not effect characters that already have a level in Eldritch Knight, and can be disabled
  in settings.
  (Helps balance Eldritch Knights with all of goodies they get in this mod, and picking
  a martial class makes it more fun.)

Other features:

- (off by default) Show custom portraits in the main portrait display. Requires restart
  to take effect.
  (This is similar to the Better Portraits mod bundled with Kingmaker Mod Loader, but
  uses a simpler/less resource intense approach--it only preloads the small sprites.
  Added because I had problems loading KML but missed the excellent portrait feature.)

Traits
---

Many traits are implemented, chosen based on usefulness (e.g. popular traits in PnP)
and feasibility of implementing in game. Player characters get to choose 2 traits
at character creation, but they must be from different trait categories. The feat
"Additional Traits" can unlock 2 more, but they must also be from trait categories

Known issues:
---
- See https://github.com/jennyem/pathfinder-mods/issues
- The text in the mod (e.g. feat names/descriptions) is not translated/localized yet.
- All icons reuse existing game icons (for feats, abilities, spells, etc). They are not
  always a good match, especially for the new feats/traits. 
- Mystic Theurge is not currently compatible with Oracle. (The game does not support two
  spontaneous caster classes both select spells from the spell selection UI, and Mystic
  Theurge prioritzes arcane casters. For example, if Inquisitor is used with Mystic
  Theurge, their spells are selected via the feat UI. Oracle could do that too, but it's
  more work to implement/test, and not done yet.)
- Incendiary Cloud does not move away from the player (Cloudkill should too).
  Also the area is smaller than it should be (limitation of the visual effects).
- Character creation page for choosing abilities can't fit more than 6 entries, and if
  it exceeds that, it wraps in a strange looking way. Does not affect functionality.
  The mod adds up to 2 selections (favored class, favored class bonus) to the
  first ability choice page (before stats/skills) and up to 5 on the second feats page
  (2 traits, deity, plus 2 more if choosing "additional traits"), so it can trigger this
  more often than the base game would.
- Crossblooded sorcerer gets their next level spell pick on even levels, like a
  normal sorcerer does. They should start with 0 spells known and get their first spell
  on the following level (e.g. 3rd level spell at level 7 instead of 6).
  Reasons for this design:
  - Technical limitations: the spellbook level up code seemed to have problems with
    0 spells known at a level (probably fixable),
  - Balance reasons: in PnP, sorcerers can use higher level slots for lower level
    spells, so they're able to use those higher level slots, even with 0 spells known.

Game balance notes:
- This mod makes spellcasters more powerful (especially at high levels), but that's how
  PnP Pathfinder works. :)
- Aasimar and Tiefling appear to be treated as having [Scion of Humanity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-aasimar/)/[Pass for Human](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-tiefling/)
  respectively, because they are affected by humanoid affecting spells
  (e.g. Hold Person, Enlarge Person). For this reason they are allowed to qualify as Human
  for traits and favored class bonuses added by this mod.
- Eldritch Scion is very powerful in PF:K compared to PnP, because it gets sorcerer
  bloodlines instead of bloodrager bloodlines and does not need to spend Eldritch Pool
  points to use those abilities. Some things added by this mod (such as Eldritch Heritage)
  make Scion even stronger.
- Arcane Bloodline still gets the concentration bonus from the level 3 and 20 powers
  (Metamagic Adept and Arcane Apotheosis). The game developers replaced the PnP powers
  with concentration bonus ones; I didn't want to remove that in case anyone is relying
  on it for their build. Concentration bonuses are not especially powerful (at higher
  levels, the checks are easy to make), and the level 20 power is missing some of its
  features from PnP, so overall it's still decently balanced.

Existing game bugs to investigate:
- Arcane Bond for sorcerers does not seem to work with a bonded item (familiars work).
- [Dueling Swords](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/sword-dueling)
  should be usable if the character has proficiency in longswords. Exotic proficiency is only
  necessary to get the 1.5 Strength bonus as a 2-handed weapon, or to use it with Weapon Finesse.


Credits
----
I wanted to thank some other projects that made this mod possible.

[Custom Blueprints](https://github.com/spacehamster/KingmakerCustomBlueprints/)
was a huge help, making it easy easy to view the game's blueprints and see how they're implemented.

[Bag of Tricks](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/26)
was a huge help playtesting features (and it's generally a great quality of life mod).

[Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/) and
[Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) are what makes mods like this possible.

And of course, thanks to [Owlcat Games](https://owlcatgames.com/) for making such a fun game based
on Pathfinder, that inspired me to get into modding!

Last but not least, thanks to players who've given me ideas and inspiration for things to focus on.
