They can enhance your character’s skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, enabling you to further customize them. At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat, so two character traits are roughly equivalent to a bonus feat. Yet a character trait isn’t just another kind of power you can add on to your character—it’s a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into your campaign world. Think of character traits as “story seeds” for your background; after you pick your two traits, you’ll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character’s personality and history. Alternatively, if you’ve already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking their traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies their other strengths and weaknesses.",
